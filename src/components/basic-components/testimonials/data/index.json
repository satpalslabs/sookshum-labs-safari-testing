Sookshum-Labs patiently guided us and worked with us, at our speed, to build an eCommerce store we are proud of. Right from the start we found them to be professional and efficient. They did what they said they would do, on time and as agreed. We never had to push them for deliverables. Their project management was tight, and I felt we were always in control of our project. I would not hesitate to work with Sookshum-Labs again.",
